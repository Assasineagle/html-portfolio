        <h3>To tell you about LNMIIT jaipur in a nutshell<br>

            LNMIIT is a Tier 1.5 IT institute which is in the growing phase. <br>
            
            LNMIIT is a PPP model college just like IIITs .Its is a partnership between Govt of Rajasthan and LNM foundation. <br>
            
            The college is excellent for you if and only if you are serious about making a career in tech firms or you are looking to join a college with excellent Research oppertunities at undergrad level. <br>
            
            first i‚Äôll bust the rumors that are spreading about the college and then ill list out pros and cons. <br>
            <ol>
            <li>Placements are fake - No the report is submitted to nirf‚Ä¶ if you have a doubt see this year nirf report and verify it with previous year placements.About 5 percent of the placement offers are off campus but this is a standart ratio present in almost all tier 1 colleges.There is a campaign going on quora to disregard the placements of LNMIIT and i get many DM regarding that. Rest assured majority(>95%) of the students are placed on campus and some students apart from the regular campus job also get an extra job offer off campus . That being said the top tier tech firms hire On campus here.Even google has started a hiring process for LNMIIT similar to what is followed by google at other tier 1 colleges like nsit, iiit delhi etc . The proces here is exactly the same. This Year (2021) the highest package is offered by google and the 63 lpa offer in 2020 was an internationaal offer.Off campus offers in the placement stats are a common thing in other tier 1 colleges‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ DO you think that the crores of package at IIIT b , nsit, happen on campus?? This is a common practice at other tier 1 colleges.
            
            One more important thing I can stand behind is that 95% of the placements shown on the website are on campus. A lot of people take an extra job off campus . Most of the top tier product firms hire on campus here owing to the top tier coding culture!!.
            
            If you talk to people currently studying at LNMIIT they will obviously validate the amazing list of companies hiring here ON CAMPUS many of which dont even go to many nits for hiring!!!
            
        </li><li>Teachers fail students deliberately - NO that does not happen .. LNMIIT follows a relative grading policy and your marks are alloted according to class averages . Here is the exact grading policy of LNMIIT. BUT BE PREPARED FOR A RIGOUROUS ACADEMIC SYSTEM.</li>
